        <h2>Theory: Strings</h2>
        <section class="theory-content">
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p> A string is a fundamental data type representing a sequence of characters. These characters can include letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace. Strings are typically used to store and manipulate textual data in programming. </p>
            <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sequence of Characters:</strong> Strings maintain the order of their characters. The first character is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.</li>
                <li><strong>Immutability (Commonly):</strong> In many popular languages (like Java, Python, JavaScript, C#), strings are <strong>immutable</strong>. This means that once a string object is created, its content cannot be changed. Operations that appear to modify a string (like concatenation or replacing characters) actually create and return a *new* string object. Some languages (like C/C++) handle strings as mutable arrays of characters.</li>
                <li><strong>Indexed Access:</strong> Individual characters within a string can often be accessed using their numerical index, similar to arrays (e.g., <code>myString[0]</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Length Property:</strong> Strings usually have a property or method to determine their length (the number of characters they contain).</li>
                <li><strong>Character Encoding:</strong> Underlyingly, characters are represented by numerical codes (like ASCII or Unicode/UTF-8). This is usually handled transparently by the language but can be important for internationalization or complex text processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Time Complexity (Big O Notation)</h3>
             <ul> <li><strong>Access Character (by index):</strong> Typically O(1) - Constant time.</li> <li><strong>Get Length:</strong> Typically O(1) - Constant time (length is often stored).</li> <li><strong>Concatenation (e.g., <code>str1 + str2</code>):</strong> O(n + m) - Linear time, where n and m are the lengths of the strings being combined. This is because a new string must be created, and characters from both original strings need to be copied into it (due to immutability). Repeated concatenation in a loop can be inefficient (O(n^2)). String builder/buffer classes can optimize this.</li> <li><strong>Search (for a character or simple substring):</strong> Typically O(n) or O(n*m) - Linear time (n = length of string, m = length of substring). More advanced algorithms exist but simple search often involves checking parts of the string.</li> <li><strong>Slicing/Substring Creation:</strong> Often O(k) - Linear time, where k is the length of the substring being created, as a new string object is usually formed.</li> </ul>
            <h3>Common Operations & Use Cases</h3>
            <ul> <li>Storing names, sentences, messages, code, file paths, URLs, configuration data.</li> <li>Reading user input and displaying output.</li> <li>Parsing text files (logs, CSV, JSON, XML).</li> <li>String manipulation: searching, replacing, splitting, joining, changing case.</li> <li>Data validation (e.g., checking email format).</li> <li>Used as keys in dictionaries/hash maps.</li> </ul>
            <h3>Example (JavaScript)</h3>
            <pre><code>// Creating strings
let greeting = "Hello";
let target = 'World';
let language = `JavaScript`; // Template literal

// Accessing characters (read-only due to immutability)
console.log(greeting[0]); // Output: H
console.log(language[4]); // Output: S

// Getting the length
console.log(target.length); // Output: 5

// Concatenation (creates a new string)
let message = greeting + ", " + target + "!"; // message is "Hello, World!"
console.log(message);
let originalGreeting = greeting; // Store original
greeting = greeting + " User"; // greeting is now a NEW string "Hello User"
console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello User
console.log(originalGreeting); // Output: Hello (original is unchanged)


// Common methods (most return NEW strings)
console.log(message.toUpperCase()); // Output: HELLO, WORLD!
console.log(message.toLowerCase()); // Output: hello, world!
console.log(message.includes("World")); // Output: true
console.log(message.indexOf("o")); // Output: 4 (index of the first 'o')
console.log(message.slice(0, 5)); // Output: Hello (extracts from index 0 up to, but not including, 5)
let words = message.split(" "); // Splits by space, returns ["Hello,", "World!"]
console.log(words);</code></pre>
